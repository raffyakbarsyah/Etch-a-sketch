# Etch-a-Sketch Drawing App ðŸŽ¨

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project is a browser-based sketchpad that mimics the behavior of an Etch-A-Sketch. It was created as a DOM manipulation exercise as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal was to practice dynamic HTML element creation, event handling, and layout with Flexbox.
